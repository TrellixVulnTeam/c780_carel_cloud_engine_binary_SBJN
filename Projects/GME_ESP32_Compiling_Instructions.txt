The RELEASE FW of the gateway includes
a. the all in one version for the GME WiFi and 2G model
b. the version for bCU embedded gateway


To build te RELEASE version of the FW you need to 

1. check CAREL_GLOBAL_DEF.h and decomment 
   a. #define __USE_CAREL_BCU_HW if needed 
   b. check and comment out //#define __CCL_DEBUG_MODE
      
2. go to development enviroment and via MAKE MENUCONFIG check CAREFULLY  
   the list of item below

a. Bootloader log verbosity --> No output
b. Security feature -->
   2_1. Require signed app images                                             <<< TO BE CONFIRMED
   2_2. Enable hardware secure boot in bootloader (READ DOCS FIRST)
   2_3. Enable flash encryption on boot (READ DOCS FIRST)                     <<<<< if make sense

c. Compiler Option -->
   3_1.Optimization level --> Release
   3_2.Assertion level    --> Disabled
   
d. Component Config -->
   4_1. ESP32-specific    --> Rev.1
   
   4_2. Common ESP-related --> UART for console ouput --> NONE
   4_3. Task Watchdog timeout period -->  60 sec
   4_4. Ethernet --> Support ESP32 internal ... --> unselect
                 --> SPI ...                    --> unselect
				 
   4_5. HTTP Server --> Max HTTP Request ...    --> 1792                      <<<<< esiste ancora il bug overflow?
   4_6. Log Output --> Default log ...          --> none

   4_7. Wi-Fi Provisioning Manager --> Max Wi-Fi Scan Result Entries --> 16
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
     
   
   
IMPORTANT NOTE
===============
- Bootloader di default viene disabilitato se secure boot è attivo
  quindi non funziona più il sistema del boot  


Your FLASH_CRYPT_CNT=3 means encryption should be disabled and you should be able to 
reflash plaintext signed binaries. But if you don't have the flash encryption key be 
very careful, you only get to flash 4 times total and in this case you should leave 
encryption off during development because you are not using OTA update. 
You need to have the flash encryption key if you want to reflash pre-encrypted signed 
binaries without incrementing the FLASH_CRYPT_CNT.
